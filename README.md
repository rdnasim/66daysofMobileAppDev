# 66daysofMobileAppDev
*Welcome! Here I can learn the rules, get answers to my questions by reading the FAQ, and find out more about the community 
thatâ€™s growing around the challenge.*

> ## Two Main Rules
  1. Code minimum 5 hour every day for the next 66 days.
  2. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nasimsclip)/[Tweet](https://twitter.com/rdnasim) my progress every day with 
  the #66DaysOfMobileAppDev hashtag. And share my github repository for the reference work.

**N.B.** (Each week, reach out to at least two people on Facebook/Twitter who are also doing the challenge)
